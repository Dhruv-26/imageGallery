# Image Gallery Website

This Image Gallery website is a simple and visually appealing project built using HTML and CSS. It features a grid layout displaying multiple images, each initially appearing in grayscale. When a user hovers over an image, it transitions to full color, creating an interactive and engaging effect. This hover effect is achieved using CSS by applying the filter: grayscale(0%) property to the image inside a card. The design is minimalistic and clean, ensuring a smooth user experience while keeping the focus on the images. The gallery layout is also responsive, making it adaptable to different screen sizes.
